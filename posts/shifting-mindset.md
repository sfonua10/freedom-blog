Drugs/Alcohol, gambling and other substances can be addicting and life threatening. I never had issues with these things in my life. However, I have had issues with pornography/lust, which can be looked at as an addictive behavior. 

My Goal and desire, is that I look at pornography/lust and even anger, the same way I look at drugs and alcohol and gambling. I want to get to the point where it's not even a temptation. How do I get to that point? 

One thing to note is that I've never used cigarettes or drank alcohol intentionally. So I don't know what kinds of affects it can have on me. I've never really been lurred into experimenting with those things. However, as a young boy around 12 years old, I have been exposed to pornography. Since then, it has been an issue because I have gotten involved with it and know how it can feel when one views it and masturbates to it. It's something I've struggled with ever since. I want to be free from it. I want it to not even be a temptation for me any more. I want to truly see it as other addictive behaviors, where it has no power over me.

When I'm feeling low and down, and look for things to pick me up. Sometimes that's all there is fighting for my attention and my consumption. Sometimes during those times, I feel lazy and don't feel like doing something that would change the chemistry in my mind and body, even though I know I shouldn't risk it.
