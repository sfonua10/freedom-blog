* Virtuous people are clean and pure spiritually. (3)  
* Virtious people focus on righteous, uplifting thoughts and put unworthy thoughts that lead to inappropriate actions out of their minds. (4)

* Quickly repent of any sins or wrongdoings. (6)  

> # *Examples*: 
John and Louise, a married couple, are both in the kitchen. John is stressed from work, and when Louise asks John if he took out the trash and has done the laundry, John feels like she's nagging him and gets annoyed at the question. Inwardly, he's feeling heated and angry, but outwardly, he says, "I'll get to it right now honey" (1)  

Jimmy's parents leave for a date. He decides to watch a movie he wouldn't normally watch with his parents in the home. (2)  

At the end of each day, Adam ponders his day. He gets on his knees to repent of his mistakes. He does this every day for years. (3)(6)    

Sam works on his PC everyday. As he's working, an inappropriate ad appears. He scrolls the ad out of view. The images are not bothering him. He says a prayer to God for his mind to be pure and then puts on uplifting music to help. He recites a scripture to help change the state and chemistry of his mind and body. (4)

# LESSON

Your mind is like a stage in a theater; in the theater of your mind, however, only one actor can be on stage at a time. If the stage is left bare, thoughts of darkness and sin often enter the stage to tempt. But these thoughts have no power if the stage of your mind is __occupied__ by wholesome thoughts, such as a *memorized hymn or verse of scripture* that you can **call upon in a moment of temptation**. By controlling the stage of your mind, you can successfully resist persistent urges to yield to temptation and indulge in sin. You can become pure and virtuous.


It's better to prevent thoughts from creeping in than kicking it out, but both are essential. (BoM war retaining cities)
